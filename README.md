# How to Play
1. Click on the clue you would like to view
2. If a player has an answer, they should buzz and state their answer. The buzzing method should be decided among the players before the game begins.
3. Once a player buzzes an answer, click the "Show answer" button below the clue to reveal the answer. From this, decide whether the answer given by the player was correct or incorrect using the honor system.
4. After checking their answer, click the + or - button next to their score whether their answer was correct or incorrect, respectively. This will increment their score by the proper amount.
5. In the case of a Daily Double or Final Jeopardy, enter each player's wager individually, and the + and - buttons will adjust each player's score by their own wager.
6. When finished with a clue, click the "Back to Board" button to return to the game board and select another clue.
